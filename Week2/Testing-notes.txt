Notes
- Maven - Predefined project architecture
	- Project management tool and build automation tool.
		-Project management
			-Handles our dependencies for us.
				- refers to framework/libraries by other developers to be used in your project.
					- based on:
						- groupId
						- artifactId
						- version
					- Leverages JUnit dependency for testing. 
					- Maven allows for quick search for dependencies
						https://mvnrepository.com/
			- in the pom.xml file
				- Project object model
					- you can know what a developers development environment is by the .pom file. 
					- helps ensure that everyone on the team is working with the same dependencies and versions. 
				- Maven creates a folder to store dependencies. .m2 folder
	- Build automation tool
		- manages the lifecycle of your application.
		- bundle your files into an artifact.
		- goal of maven is to create an artifact to be deployed. 
			- three build lifecycles
				- clean    (mvn clean)
					- remove/clean previous artifacts. (.jar/war)
				- default
					- test/package your application
						- validate
						- test -> compiled code is tested
						- package -> packages all the compiled code into a war/jar file
						- verify
						- install
						- deploy

		- Basic project structure
			- src/main/java
				- where your packages/classes go
			- src/main/resources
				- resources such as files to configure the frameworks/libraries
			- src/test/java
				- where test classes are 
			- src/test/resoruces
				- where resources like files related to testing go
			-pom.xml
				- project object model which (contains metadata about project, properties, dependencies, build details)


Testing
			- People often test with a bunch of SYSout.
	- Concepts
				- refers to the process of making sure an application is working correctly. 
		- positive testing
			- making sure that an application handles the correct input.
		- negative testing
			- making sure that an application handles the incorrect inputs. 
		- regression testing
			- use the test to ensure that new code/feature(s) doesn't break old/previously written code.
	types of testing. Based on frequency of uses
		- unit testing (this is the one we will talk about) (JUnit is a unit testing framework for Java)
			- can design methods to be testable?
			- at the bottom of the testing pyramid, therefore the most abundant type of testing. 
				- JUnit framework for Java
			- TDD Test Drive Development. 
				- the process of writing tests to fail first to test the functionality of your application
				way to approach
					- write interfaces/empty methods to establish the functionality desired. 
					- write your tests. 
					- write code and implement your methods. 

		- integration testing. Do methods work well apart and together.
		- System testing. Do all the pieces work well together.
		- User acceptance testing (UAT)
		
JUnit
	- JUnit is a Java Unit Testing Framework
		- JUnit 5
	- Includes a lot of annotations and classes in order to write automated tests.
	- leverages the "assert" methods to check for a particular condition to determine if a test passes. 
		- a test passes when it catches what it was intended to catch. 
		- acheive code coverage by testing all of your code. 

	JUnit Annotations
		- @BeforeEach
		- @AfterEach
		- @BeforeAll
		- @AfterAll
		- @Test
		- @Ignore
		- @Order

			@BeforeEach
			public void beforeEach() {
				System.out.println("Running before each test");
}
			@AfterEach
			public void afterEach() {



write tests for the remainders of the test (@orders) to run tests in order.

implement those tests.

check for not dividing by zero. throw in exception. If statement. If second value is zero, throw in exception. 
extend from runtime exceptions. Arithmetic exceptions
must see that exception exists
assertThrows method (in maven)

checks if a number is prime. public boolean isPrime(int i)
	return true;

we are checking if the return value for  is 0 or true or (a certain value)
