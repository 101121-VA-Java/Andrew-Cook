	result = "You did great!"; 		// If the above statement evaluates to true, You did great! is assigned to result and expression breaks to after the else statement. If not, skip to the next statement.

	result = "You did not pass. Try again!"; 	// The result variable is assigned a string value of You did not pass. Try again!" 
}

System.out.println(result); 			// The system will print out the result variable. In our case, a score of 80 means the line will print You passed!
