In the full stack, we have worked with the backend.
Now we will focus on and work with the front end. 
Languages
	HTML 
	CSS
	JavaScript
	HTTP




	- Inspect button
		- html for webpage on the left side.
		- Styles on the right. CSS
		- 
			

Resources
	- w3schools (great for HTML CSS JavaScript)
		- great for styling
	- Mozilla developer Javascript resources. 
		- tutorials




HTML 
	- Hypertext Mark-up Language
		- not a programming language
	- Used to define the structure of a webpage using HTML tags.
		- we're going to be using tags following a nested structure
		- structure of an HTML document.
			- Doctype Declaration (optional as of html5)
				- tag that indicates the file as an HTML doc.
			- html
				- head
					- metadata (information about the webpage)
				- body
					- information display on the webpage

	- Elements in HTML have attributes.
		- these are used to provide information. 
			- more information regarding the tab. 

			- Global attributes
				- present in all html tags
				- class, id, style
			- local attributes
				- used in specific tags
					- src, href
		- ie:
			<div id=
	- Semantic elements
		- concept introduced in html5
		- provides more meaning for tags. 
			- helps with accessiblitiy
		- names such as 
			- nav, main, section, footer, header. instead of divs everywhere. 
	- Headers
		- h1 -> h6
		- biggest to smallest
	- Forms
		- tags that can be used to take user input and submit information. 
			- can submit information without JS, just using attribute.
				- method: specify the HTTP method
				- action: specify the url

	- Self-closing tags
		- elements that do not require a closing tag. 

	-List
		Ordered and unordered list
			- ol
				- ordered list
			- ul
				- unordered list

CSS
	- Cascading Style Sheets
		- style is loaded from top to bottom.
	- adds looks/styles to HTML
		- HTML is the structure of the webpage, CSS is the styling
	- add CSS into the web page.
		- inline
			- in the HTML tag via attribute
				- <div id="div1" style="color: cornflowerblue:"></div>
		- internally
			- in the HTML document, in the head tag
				- <style>
					selector {
					property: value;
					}
				- </style>
		- externally
			- from external stylsheets
				- best practice to reuse stylesheet. 
			- 
		- Selector
			- target specific elements to be styled
				- tag
				- class
				- id
				- target elements more specifically
					- ie: nested elements
					- w3schools/css_selectors

		- styles apply based on specificty, most specific elements will overrule
			- most to least: id > class > 

	CSS Box Model  (common interview question)
			- content inside the padding inside the border inside the margin
		- Margin | Border | Padding | Content
